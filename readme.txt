this is version 0.xx - still less than 1.  bugs must likely.  i have only tested it on XP - please let me know how it works for you.

configuration data is stored in yuki.ini next to yuki.scr.  if you are using vista are having write-permisions problems, then try running it from your home directory.  i am only guessing here as i don't have access to a vista machine (not that i really want to).

notes on pseudo-code text files:
- files are chosen at random.
- they will be displayed one line at a time, except when a line started with a dot (".").  a dot denotes a line that should be "typed" character by character.
- you can add more code by placing new txt files in the "psudo-code" folder.  at start up, the app will scan the folder for any files with a .txt extension.
- in order to make things more interesting, i have / will scavenge any interesting looking code from where ever find it.  if anyone who owns any of the code used feels that rights have been breached, please contact me to resolve the issue.
