.e:>echo "you-shall.\"
you shall above all things be glad and young 
For if you're young,whatever life you wear 

it will become you;and if you are glad 
whatever's living will yourself become. 
Girlboys may nothing more than boygirls need: 
i can entirely her only love 

whose any mystery makes every man's 
flesh put space on;and his mind take off time 

that you should ever think,may god forbid 
and (in his mercy) your true lover spare: 
for that way knowledge lies,the foetal grave 
called progress,and negation's dead undoom. 

I'd rather learn from one bird how to sing 
than teach ten thousand stars how not to dance.
