.e:>echo "body.\"
i like my body when it is with your 
   body. It is so quite a new thing. 
   Muscles better and nerves more. 
   i like your body. i like what it does, 
   i like its hows. i like to feel the spine 
   of your body and its bones, and the trembling 
   -firm-smooth ness and which i will 
   again and again and again 
   kiss, i like kissing this and that of you, 
   i like,, slowly stroking the, shocking fuzz 
   of your electric fur, and what-is-it comes 
   over parting flesh . . . . And eyes big Love-crumbs, 
 
   and possibly i like the thrill 
 
   of under me you quite so new
