.c:>echo "you.\"
if i love You 
(thickness means 
worlds inhabited by roamingly 
stern bright faeries 
 
if you love 
me) distance is mind carefully 
luminous with innumerable gnomes 
Of complete dream 
 
if we love each (shyly) 
other, what clouds do or Silently 
Flowers resembles beauty 
less than our breathing
