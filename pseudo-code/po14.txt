.d:>echo "somewhere.\"
somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond 
any experience,your eyes have their silence: 
in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me, 
or which i cannot touch because they are too near 
 
your slightest look easily will unclose me 
though i have closed myself as fingers, 
you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens 
(touching skilfully,mysteriously) her first rose 
 
or if your wish be to close me,i and 
my life will shut very beautifully, suddenly, 
as when the heart of this flower imagines 
the snow carefully everywhere descending; 
 
nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals 
the power of your intense fragility: whose texture 
compels me with the color of its countries, 
rendering death and forever with each breathing 
 
(i do not know what it is about you that closes 
and opens; only something in me understands 
the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses) 
nobody,not even the rain, has such small hands
