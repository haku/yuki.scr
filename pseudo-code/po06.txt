.d:>echo "since-feeling.\"
since feeling is first 
who pays any attention 
to the syntax of things 
will never wholly kiss you; 
 
wholly to be a fool 
while Spring is in the world 
 
my blood approves, 
and kisses are a far better fate 
than wisdom 
lady i swear by all flowers. Don't cry 
--the best gesture of my brain is less than 
your eyelids' flutter which says 
 
we are for eachother: then 
laugh, leaning back in my arms 
for life's not a paragraph 
 
And death i think is no parenthesis
