.d:>echo "the-boys.\"
   the boys i mean are not refined 
   they go with girls who buck and bite 
   they do not give a fuck for luck 
   they hump them thirteen times a night 
 
   one hangs a hat upon her tit 
   one carves a cross on her behind 
   they do not give a shit for wit 
   the boys i mean are not refined 
 
   they come with girls who bite and buck 
   who cannot read and cannot write 
   who laugh like they would fall apart 
   and masturbate with dynamite 
 
   the boys i mean are not refined 
   they cannot chat of that and this 
   they do not give a fart for art 
   they kill like you would take a piss 
 
   they speak whatever's on their mind 
   they do whatever's in their pants 
   the boys i mean are not refined 
   they shake the mountains when they dance
