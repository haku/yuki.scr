.d:>echo "love.\"
i love you much(most beautiful darling) 

more than anyone on the earth and i 
like you better than everything in the sky 

-sunlight and singing welcome your coming 

although winter may be everywhere 
with such a silence and such a darkness 
noone can quite begin to guess 

(except my life)the true time of year- 

and if what calls itself a world should have 
the luck to hear such singing(or glimpse such 
sunlight as will leap higher than high 
through gayer than gayest someone's heart at your each 

nearness)everyone certainly would(my 
most beautiful darling)believe in nothing but love
